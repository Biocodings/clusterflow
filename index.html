Welcome to the new home of Cluster Flow. As of version 0.2, this website will serve as the primary home for the Cluster Flow documentation.

**This documentation is still under construction.** For now, please see the [PDF manual]({{base.url}}/resources/old_manual/Cluster_Flow_Manual.pdf).

Cluster Flow is a command-line program which uses common cluster managers to run analysis pipelines. It currently supports GRIDEngine (SGE), LSF and SLURM, plus it should be fairly easy to port to others.

Benefits of using Cluster Flow:

* Routine analyses are very quick to run, for example: `cf --genome GRCh37 fastq_bowtie *fq.gz`
* Pipelines use identical parameters, standardising analysis and making results more reproducable
* Integrated parallelisation tools help prevent your cluster becoming overloaded
* All commands and output is logged in files for future reference
* Intuitive commands and a comprehensive manual make Cluster Flow easy to use
* Very easy to get up and running (in theory at least!)

How Cluster Flow differs from other pipeline tools:

* Very lightweight and flexible
* Pipelines and configurations can easily be generated on a project-specific basis if required
* New modules and pipelines are super easy to write (see video tutorial)

## Tutorial Videos
There are two tutorial videos up on YouTube, see below:

* [Usage / Installation Tutorial](http://youtu.be/b2g_zQiz9ys) - How to configure and run Cluster Flow
* [Advanced Tutorial](http://youtu.be/aBHOcsA2M6w) - How to write your own pipelines and modules

Please see the sidebar for access to the full Cluster Flow documentation. If you're looking for a quick overview of what Cluster Flow is and how it works, see the [Introduction](/introduction/).

## Contributing to Cluster Flow
If you write a module or pipeline which could be of use to others, or modify the core Cluster Flow code in a helpful way, it would be great to merge those changes back into the core Cluster Flow project.

The easiest way to do this is to [fork the Cluster Flow repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make your changes, committing them and pushing them as you go. When you've finished, submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and the new code can be merged into the central project.

## Change Log
* v0.2 devel
	* Ported repository to github
	* Wrote new readme for github
	* Bugfix: Custom modules in `~/clusterflow/modules/` weren't being found
* v0.1
	* The first public release of Cluster Flow, although it's been in use at the Babraham Institute for around 6 months. It's been in heavy development throughout that time and is now approaching a state of being relatively stable.
